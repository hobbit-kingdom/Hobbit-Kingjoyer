# The Hobbit KingJoyer

A trainer for The Hobbit (2003) game written in C++ and ImGui. Modifies the process memory to achieve developer or completely new functionality.

## Usage

Run it before or after the game starts. Use **Alt + Tab** to navigate between trainer and the game.

If you prefer the Trainer to be injected in the game to use it **seamlessly**, use the [INJECTED EDITION](https://github.com/hobbit-kingdom/Hobbit-Kingjoyer-Injected-Edition).
